# UNsupervised Learning Group Work
This project was developed as part of a team of 3 students exploring **Unsupervised Machine Learning** techniques using multiple datasets and algorithms.

## Team Members
- Maroua Boumchich
- Oumaima Ajana
- Ouafae El Makoudi

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to apply **unsupervised learning techniques** to discover patterns, groupings, or anomalies using :
- **Hierarchical Clustering**
- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**
---

## My Contribution: PCA

### Algorithms Applied:
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** for dimensionality reduction and visualization

### Dataset
- Mall_Customers.csv

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

---

## The project might be improved in the future

- Try t-SNE or UMAP for better visualization
- Combine clustering with supervised fine-tuning
